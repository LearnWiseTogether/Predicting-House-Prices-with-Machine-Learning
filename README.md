# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Machine-Learning
This repository provides a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The model leverages techniques in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to deliver accurate price estimates. This project demonstrates the use of data science techniques in real estate valuation.

# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on predicting house prices using a machine learning model. The goal is to utilize historical data on real estate prices and features to build a model that can accurately estimate house prices for new listings. This project covers the end-to-end process, from data cleaning and analysis to model building and evaluation.

## Project Overview
- **Project Title:** Predicting House Prices
- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a set of input features.
- **Tools and Libraries Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure
The main notebook file contains the following sections:
1. **Data Loading** - Loading the dataset and basic inspection.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing distributions and relationships between features and target variables.
4. **Model Training** - Building and training a regression model to predict house prices.
5. **Model Evaluation** - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R².

## Getting Started

Dataset
Dataset Name: House Prices Data
Source: Include a link to the dataset if it's publicly available or describe how to access it.
Results
The final model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of [Insert Value] and an R² score of [Insert Value] on the test dataset, indicating good predictive accuracy.

Future Improvements
Explore feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
Experiment with additional machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Integrate a web interface to allow users to input data and get real-time predictions.
